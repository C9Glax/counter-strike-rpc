This is a Windows-Service that will automatically Start, install itself into CS:GO (readup on csgo-gamestate) and send data as Richpresence to Discord.  

##Installation

To install download the Application and run 'install.bat' **As Administrator**.  

##Download  

Simply download the archive

As of now, the program only works with the default installation-location.
If you have a suggestion on how to easily change/grab the installation-location, let me know.
