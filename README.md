# Notes for u/Lilwiggy
Hey, so I got nearly everything Set up, except the service installer, etc.
Also I just pasted your code for the Presence at the bottom of Service.cs because I didn't come far enough to actually test anything.
For some reason the Task.Run() will simply quit at httplistener.GetContext() and I don't know why.
